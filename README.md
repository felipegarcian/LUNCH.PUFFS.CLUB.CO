The Rat-Pigeon has accomplished to get out of his cage and now is running to freedom. 
On his way out needs to switch between his rat and pigeon skills, running and flying to find his route out. 
When running avoid the rat tramps around the laboratory... 
And flying to avoids cats that obviously love the flavor of a Rat-Pigeon...
